## 2/25
- Star topology vs. $K_3$?
  - Star would be much simpler, but communication would be constrained to central node
  - $K_3$ would low direct messaging between hosts, but more complex for each host to maintain
    - It is more **P2P**, not entirely sure how they would "discover" each other
  - Think star is fine as we do not care that much about network throughput in this design exercise
